function [globalPromiscuity, localPromiscuity] = promiscuity(dynamicCommStruc)
%%  Find the Promiscuity of a Dynamic Network
%   
%   Find the local and global promiscuity of a network from its dynamic community structure. A node with low promiscuity tends to remain in the same community over time, 
%   whereas a node with high promiscuity tends to participate in a large number of the available communities. 
%
%   The local promiscuity of a node is measured as the number of communities it participates in divided by the total number of communities. 
%   Global Promiscuity is the average promiscuity of each node in the network.

%   INPUT 
%
%           dynamicCommStruc        =   [Node X Time] matrix with the community affiliation of each node at each time point, as retrieved from dynamicCommStruc 
%
%   OUTPUT
%
%           globalPromiscuity       =    Average promiscuity of each node in the network.
%           localPromiscuity         =   Vector with local promiscuity of each node.
