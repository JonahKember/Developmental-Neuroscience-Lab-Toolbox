function staticCS = staticCommStruc(Network)
%%  
%  Detect the community structure over time of static networks over time.
%
%  Note: Static community structures over time should NOT be used in any analyses that require a dynamic community structure (i.e., flexibility, promiscuity).
%  Since the communities that exist betwen time points have not yet been related to one another, those measures are meaningless. In order to use those analyses,
%  static community structures shuold be run through the script 'dynamicCommStruc', which meaningfully relates communities at time (t) with time (t + 1).
%
%  Note: Due to the algorithm used to detect community structure, there may be some very minor random variation from one run to another (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method).
