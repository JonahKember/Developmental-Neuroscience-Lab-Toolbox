function B = burstiness(network)
%
%   The 'inter-contact-time' between two nodes is the length of time it takes for a connection to form between those two nodes.
%   A 'burst' is when two nodes show very short inter-contact times (consecutive connections in time), followed by longer and more variable inter-contact 
%   times (long periods of time without forming a connection). When the distribution of all these inter-contact-times shows a 'heavy-tail distribution', 
%   it is said to have high burstiness. Burstiness has been found in resting-state fMRI and EEG data (Thompson et al., 2017).
