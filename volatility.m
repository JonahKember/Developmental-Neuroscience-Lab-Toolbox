function V = volatility(network)
%
%   Calculate the volatility of a dynamic network. Volatility, as defined by Thompson et al. (2016) measures how much, 
%   on average, connectivity between consecutive networks tends to change over the course of the network's evolution.
%
%   INPUT:
%
%           network  =     [Node X Node X Time] 3-dimensinoal array of adjacency matrices over time.    
%
%   OUTPUT:
%
%              V     =      Volatility
